About : 
The Restaurant Image Classification project, developed as the capstone project for Infinite Learning Indonesia, utilizes Python and Keras to build a powerful image classification system. By employing the VGG-16 architecture, the project aims to classify restaurant images into various categories such as food dishes, interior decor, ambiance, and menu items. The project encompasses data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and user interface development. The outcome includes a fine-tuned VGG-16 model, a user-friendly application, performance evaluation metrics, and a comprehensive report highlighting the project's methodology and findings. By automating image analysis, this project contributes to the advancement of computer vision applications in the restaurant industry, assisting restaurant owners and marketers in managing visual content and understanding customer preferences.
